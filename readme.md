# Markdown on Save

This is a fork of https://github.com/markjaquith/markdown-on-save with two changes:

1. Replaces the included [PHP Markdown](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/) which was a really old version with the much better [CommonMark](http://commonmark.thephpleague.com/).
2. Adds a `composer.json` to make it a Composer package and requires CommonMark as a dependency.

See the original [README](https://github.com/markjaquith/markdown-on-save/blob/master/readme.md) for more details.
